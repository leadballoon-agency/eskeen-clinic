## ✅ Better Touch Targets
- Larger tap areas on buttons (py-4 for primary CTAs)

## ✅ Streamlined User Flow
1. Hero: Simple 2-button choice (Assessment or Treatments)
2. Assessment: Clean 4-question flow
3. Results: One primary CTA (Book) + subtle "start over"
4. No distracting secondary paths

## ✅ Responsive Grid Updates
