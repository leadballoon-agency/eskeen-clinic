**Primary Text**:
If you're using Regaine (or thinking about it), you need to know this...

While Regaine requires daily application forever (costing ¬£400+ yearly), 300+ of your Putney neighbors have discovered a permanent solution that actually addresses the ROOT cause of hair loss.

Mavra, our Pharmacist Practitioner, explains: "Regaine only works on the surface and stops working when you stop using it. PRP reactivates your dormant follicles from within."

The difference?
‚ùå Regaine: Daily application, temporary results, ¬£400/year forever
‚úÖ PRP: 3-6 sessions, lasting results, works with your body

**Free consultation for SW London residents this week only** - see if you're a candidate.

### Version B - Elanda Background Image  
**Primary Text**:
FACT: The moment you stop using Regaine, you lose all the hair it helped you keep.

That's why 300+ local residents have switched to a treatment that gives PERMANENT results.

Nurse Elanda (9 years experience) has helped hundreds break free from the Regaine trap: "My clients were tired of the daily routine and temporary results. PRP actually restores your hair's natural growth cycle."

Why locals are making the switch:
‚úÖ No daily applications
‚úÖ Treats the cause, not symptoms  
‚úÖ One course of treatment, lasting results
‚úÖ Your own body's healing power

**FREE consultation for Putney & Wandsworth residents** (normally ¬£50)
