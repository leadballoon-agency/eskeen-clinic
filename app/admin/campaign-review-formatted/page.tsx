Primary Text:
Be Among Our First 50 Putney Patients

We're Elanda and Mavra. After treating 1,000+ patients at London's top clinics, we've opened our own practice on Lower Richmond Road.

We specialise in PRP therapy for hair restoration. One treatment course, permanent results. No monthly prescriptions or daily routines.

Most of our patients are professionals who simply want to look as sharp as they feel. If that sounds like you, we should talk.

Founding patient benefits:
• Free consultation (usually £100)
• Special rate: £350 (usually £500)
• Priority booking for life

Limited to first 50 patients.

1,000+ Successful Hair Treatments - Now in Putney

We've spent years perfecting PRP therapy at London's leading clinics. Now we're bringing that expertise to your neighborhood.

What our patients say matters most:
"Wish I'd done this years ago" - James, 44
"Finally, a treatment that actually works" - David, 38
"No side effects, real results" - Michael, 42

PRP uses your own blood's growth factors. It's not magic - it's proven medical science we've been doing for years.

Primary Text:
An Honest Conversation About Hair Loss
From Practitioners Who've Seen It All

After treating 1,000+ patients, we know what works and what doesn't.

Regaine? Temporary at best.
Finasteride? Those side effects are real.
Turkey transplant? We've fixed too many disasters.

PRP is different. Your own blood, permanent results, no daily hassle. We've just opened in Putney and we're offering founding patient rates to build our local practice.

Free consultation. Honest advice. Real results.

Hair Loss Treatment That Actually Works
New Putney Clinic - Founding Patients Wanted

The problem with most treatments:
- Regaine stops working after a year
- Finasteride risks aren't worth it
- Transplants often need repeating

Our solution: PRP therapy
- Uses your own blood's healing factors
- 3 sessions, permanent results
- No maintenance, no side effects

We're Elanda and Mavra, formerly of London's top clinics. Now taking our first 50 Putney patients at special rates.

6. SELF-LIQUIDATING OFFER (SLO) STRATEGY

WHAT IS AN SLO?
A low-priced product (£27-97) sold immediately after interest to recover ad costs instantly.

WHY ESKEEN WILL DOMINATE:
• Competitors lose money for months, you profit DAY ONE
• Spend £1,000/day while they spend £100
• Build buyer list (30-50% upgrade) vs email list (2% buy)

THE OFFER: HAIR RECOVERY STARTER PACK £37

What They Get:
1. Professional Hair Loss Recovery Guide (£40 value)
2. 30-Day Clinical Biotin Supply (£25 value)
3. WhatsApp Support Group (£22 value)
4. £50 PRP Treatment Credit (£50 value)

Total Value: £137 → Their Price: £37

THE MATH:
Without SLO: Spend £1,000 → 5 patients → £2,500 revenue → Loss £500
With SLO: Spend £1,000 → 30 packs (£1,110) → PROFIT + 10 upgrades later
