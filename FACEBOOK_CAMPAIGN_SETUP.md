### Campaign 1: Soft Launch/Founding
**Primary Text:**
Be Among Our First 50 Putney Patients

We're Elanda and Mavra. After treating 1,000+ patients at London's top clinics, we've opened our own practice on Lower Richmond Road.

We specialise in PRP therapy for hair restoration. One treatment course, permanent results. No monthly prescriptions or daily routines.

Most of our patients are professionals who simply want to look as sharp as they feel. If that sounds like you, we should talk.

Founding patient benefits:
â€¢ Free consultation (usually Â£100)
â€¢ Special rate: Â£350 (usually Â£500)
â€¢ Priority booking for life

Limited to first 50 patients.

**Description:** 1,000+ successful treatments - Now in Putney

### Campaign 2: Honest Conversation
**Primary Text:**
An Honest Conversation About Hair Loss
From Practitioners Who've Seen It All

After treating 1,000+ patients, we know what works and what doesn't.

Regaine? Temporary at best.
Finasteride? Those side effects are real.
Turkey transplant? We've fixed too many disasters.

PRP is different. Your own blood, permanent results, no daily hassle. We've just opened in Putney and we're offering founding patient rates to build our local practice.

Free consultation. Honest advice. Real results.

Images needed (in advertorial folder):
- meet Elanda and Mavra.png âœ…
- Michaels story.png âœ…
- An Honest Conversation Elanda.png âœ…
- why hairloss treatments fail after 40.png âœ…
- An Honest Conversation.png âœ…
- 300 locals switched clinic.png (needs update)

## STEP 8: RESPONSE TEMPLATES

### For Comments:
**Price Question:**
"Hi [Name], thanks for your interest! Our founding patient rate is Â£350 per session (usually Â£500). Most patients need 3 sessions for optimal results. We're offering free consultations this month to discuss your specific needs. Feel free to call 07849 990667 or click the link to learn more."

**Does it work?**
"Great question! We've successfully treated over 1,000 patients with PRP therapy. It uses your own blood's growth factors to reactivate dormant follicles. Results vary by individual, which is why we offer free consultations to assess if you're a good candidate. Click the link for more details."

**Side effects?**
"PRP uses your own blood, so there's virtually no risk of rejection or allergic reaction. Some patients experience mild tenderness at injection sites for 24-48 hours. Unlike medications like finasteride, there are no systemic side effects. Happy to discuss more during a free consultation!"

## STEP 9: SCALING STRATEGY

### Week 1 Success Metrics:
- 50+ leads generated âœ“ Scale to Â£50/day
- 30+ assessment completions âœ“ Test Instagram

- Test broader interests

### Week 4:

## TROUBLESHOOTING

- Creative fatigue - refresh images
- Headline not compelling - test variations
- Wrong audience - adjust targeting

**Good CTR but no conversions:**
