# Kerry's PRP Consultation Call Script

## Opening (Warm & Personal)
"Hi [Name], this is Kerry from Eskeen Clinic. I just saw you completed our PRP assessment online - perfect timing as I was just reviewing your results! Do you have a quick moment to discuss your personalized treatment plan?"

*[Wait for confirmation]*

"Brilliant! First, thank you for taking the time to complete the assessment. It really helps us understand exactly what you're looking for..."

## Review Their Assessment (Show You Care)
*[Pull up their GHL notes - you'll see their specific answers]*

### For Hair Loss/Thinning:
"I can see you've been dealing with [hair thinning/hair loss] for [duration]. That must be quite frustrating, especially since you've already tried [what they've tried]. The good news is, PRP works differently from [products/medications] because it uses your body's own growth factors to actually wake up dormant follicles..."

### For Facial Aging:
"I noticed you're interested in our Vampire Facial for [fine lines/loss of glow]. You mentioned you've tried [what they've tried] before - PRP is completely different because instead of just treating the surface, we're actually stimulating your own collagen production from within..."

### For Both Concerns:
"I see you're looking at addressing both hair and facial concerns - you're actually the perfect candidate for our combination package which gives you incredible value..."

## Build Trust & Urgency

"Now, based on your assessment, the system recommended [their recommended package] for you, which is absolutely spot on. [Practitioner name - Elanda or Mavra] has had amazing success with similar cases..."

### Create Gentle Urgency (Choose One):
- "We're actually running our PRP special this month with the FREE biotin injections included - that's a £50 value per session..."
- "I've got two consultation slots available this week with [Elanda/Mavra] - one on [day] and one on [day]..."
- "Since you've been dealing with this for [duration], starting sooner means better results. Every month we wait, it becomes a bit harder to reverse..."

## Handle Common Concerns

### If They're Unsure About Commitment:
"I completely understand wanting to start with one session first. Many of our clients do that. However, I always like to be transparent - PRP is a regenerative treatment, which means it builds on itself. One session will show you the process is comfortable, but you won't see the dramatic results. That's why we created the packages - so you get the results AND save money..."

### If Price is a Concern:
"I understand it's an investment. Let me put it in perspective - you're looking at about [£150/£116] per month over 3 months for the package. Compare that to years of expensive hair products that don't work, or temporary fillers that need constant top-ups. This is actually addressing the root cause..."

*[If still hesitant]*
"We do have payment plans available through Klarna if that helps - you can spread it over 3 months interest-free..."

## Close for Consultation

### Soft Close:
"The next step is to come in for your consultation where [Elanda/Mavra] will examine your [scalp/skin], show you some before-and-after photos of similar cases, and create your personalized treatment plan. The consultation is completely free and there's no obligation. When works better for you - [Day 1] or [Day 2]?"

### Assumptive Close (If They're Keen):
"Brilliant! So I'll book you in for your consultation on [day] at [time]. Now, many clients actually prefer to start their first treatment right after the consultation while they're here - should I reserve a treatment slot for you as well, just in case you'd like to begin? You can always decide on the day..."

## Booking Confirmation

"Perfect! I've got you scheduled for [day] at [time] with [practitioner]. You'll receive a confirmation text shortly. The clinic is at 115 Lower Richmond Road in Putney - there's free street parking and we're just a 5-minute walk from East Putney station."

"Is [phone number from GHL] the best number to send your confirmation to?"

## Important Details to Mention

"Just a couple of quick things for your appointment:
- Come with clean, dry hair if we're treating your scalp
- No makeup if we're doing facial treatment  
- The consultation takes about 20 minutes
- If you decide to go ahead with treatment on the day, that takes about 45 minutes"

## Closing

"Any questions before we wrap up? ... Wonderful! We're really looking forward to seeing you on [day]. If anything comes up, just call us on 07846 888649. Have a lovely [morning/afternoon/evening], [Name]!"

## Objection Handlers

**"I need to think about it"**
"Of course! It's an important decision. Can I ask what specific concerns you'd like to think through? Often I can help clarify things right now... [Address concern]. How about we book a consultation for next week? That gives you time to think, and you can ask [Elanda/Mavra] any questions directly..."

**"It's expensive"**
"I understand. Think of it this way - you're not paying for a treatment, you're investing in a permanent solution. How much have you already spent on [products/treatments] that haven't worked? This actually fixes the problem at the source..."

**"Does it really work?"**
"Absolutely! We've done over 500 PRP treatments with a 95% satisfaction rate. During your consultation, [Elanda/Mavra] will show you photos of clients with similar concerns to yours. The science is solid - we're using your body's own growth factors..."

**"I'm scared of needles"**
"That's really common! The good news is we use numbing cream, so you'll barely feel anything. It's much more comfortable than you'd expect. Most clients say 'Is that it?' when we're done. We can also talk through comfort options during your consultation..."
