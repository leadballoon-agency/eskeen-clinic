# Self-Liquidating Offer (SLO) Strategy for Eskeen Clinic
## Converting "Not Ready" Leads Into Immediate Revenue

---

## The Problem We're Solving

**Current Funnel:**
- Facebook Ad → Advertorial → Assessment → Book PRP (£350-699)
- Only 5-10% of leads book immediately
- 90-95% say "not yet" but are interested
- Lead cost: £20-40 each
- Need 10-20 leads to get 1 booking
- **Result:** £200-800 acquisition cost per patient

**With SLO:**
- Same funnel BUT...
- 20-30% buy low-ticket offer (£27-47)
- Immediately recover £5-14 per lead
- **Result:** Lead cost drops to £6-35 (or even profitable!)

## The Math That Makes This Work

### Without SLO:
```
100 leads × £30 cost = £3,000 spend
5 bookings × £500 = £2,500 revenue
Loss: -£500
```

### With SLO (Conservative):
```
100 leads × £30 cost = £3,000 spend
20 SLO sales × £37 = £740
3 PRP bookings × £500 = £1,500
Total: £2,240
Loss: -£760 → Better but not great
```

### With SLO (Optimized):
```
100 leads × £30 cost = £3,000 spend
30 SLO sales × £37 = £1,110 immediate
8 SLO→PRP upgrades × £463 = £3,704
5 direct PRP × £500 = £2,500
Total: £7,314
Profit: +£4,314 🎯
```

## SLO Sales Page Structure

### Headline Options:
1. "Start Your Hair Recovery Journey Today for Just £37"
2. "Not Ready for PRP? Try Our Starter Protocol First"
3. "The £37 Hair Loss Solution That's Helping 100+ Putney Residents"

### Page Flow:
1. **Problem** - "You want to fix your hair loss but..."
2. **Agitate** - "PRP feels like a big commitment"
3. **Solution** - "Start smaller with proven results"
4. **Credibility** - Your 1,000+ patient experience
5. **Offer Stack** - Show £87 value for £37
6. **Urgency** - "Assessment discount expires in 24 hours"
7. **Guarantee** - "100% applies to PRP treatment"
8. **CTA** - "Start Your Recovery Today"

### Key Psychology:
- **Commitment & Consistency**: Small yes leads to big yes
- **Reciprocity**: Give value first, ask for treatment second
- **Social Proof**: "300+ started with the guide"
- **Loss Aversion**: "Your assessment discount expires..."

## Why This Will Transform Eskeen's Marketing

### Before SLO:
- High customer acquisition cost
- Long payback period
- Can't scale aggressively
- Waste 90% of leads

### After SLO:
- Break even on ad spend immediately
- Build buyer list (not just leads)
- Create natural upgrade path
- Can outspend competitors

### The Real Magic:
Once someone pays you £37, they're 10x more likely to buy PRP.
You've moved them from "prospect" to "customer."
The hardest sale is the first one - make it easy!

---

## Next Steps

1. **Pick your SLO** - I recommend Option 1 (Guide + Biotin)
2. **Price it right** - £37 is the sweet spot
3. **Create urgency** - 24-hour assessment discount
4. **Track everything** - Every penny matters
5. **Optimize relentlessly** - Small improvements = big profits

---

*Remember: The goal isn't to make money on the SLO.*
*It's to turn expensive leads into break-even or profitable leads.*
*The real money comes from the PRP upgrades.*
