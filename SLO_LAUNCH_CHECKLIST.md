## ðŸ’¡ TALKING POINTS FOR ELANDA & MAVRA

- **Builds trust** - They try products first
- **Self-funding** - Ad costs covered by product sale
- **Qualified leads** - Buyers are serious about hair loss
- **Upsell opportunity** - Â£50 voucher drives PRP bookings

### Objection Handlers:
**"It's too cheap"**
- It's a loss leader to acquire customers
- Real profit comes from PRP treatments
- Builds trust before big purchase

**"Too much work"**
- Kerry can pre-package 20-30 units
- Simple fulfillment process
- Generates warm leads automatically

**"What if they don't book PRP?"**
- Still breaks even on ad spend
- Builds email list
- Can retarget with offers
