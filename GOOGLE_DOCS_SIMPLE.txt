An Honest Conversation About Hair Loss
From Practitioners Who've Seen It All

After treating 1,000+ patients, we know what works and what doesn't.

Regaine? Temporary at best.
Finasteride? Those side effects are real.
Turkey transplant? We've fixed too many disasters.

PRP is different. Your own blood, permanent results, no daily hassle. We've just opened in Putney and we're offering founding patient rates to build our local practice.

Free consultation. Honest advice. Real results.
